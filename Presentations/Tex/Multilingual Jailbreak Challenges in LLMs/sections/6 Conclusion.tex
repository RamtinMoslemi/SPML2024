    \begin{itemize}
        \item In this paper, we investigate the presence of multilingual jailbreak challenges in LLMs and consider two risky scenarios: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Unintentional
            \item Intentional
        \end{itemize}
        \item Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that multilingual languages can serve as a potential jailbreak method in both scenarios, posing significant threats.
        \item To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel framework called SELF-DEFENSE, which has proven to be highly effective in enhancing the multilingual safety capabilities of LLMs.
    \end{itemize}
